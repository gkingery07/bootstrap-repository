                    <p class="text-justify"> I grew up in Denver, Colorado and lived there for 24 years.
                        Throughout my childhood and into adulthood my entire life has revolved around playing,
                        watching or talking about sports! Any time my friends or family have a queston they
                        always ask me, whether it's about a team, player or who they should bet on. I moved to
                        Pleasant Grove, Utah with my girlfriend in July 2018 and have really enjoyed my short
                        time out here. I joined this program because I am tired of my current job and am looking
                        for an opportunity to begin a career!! In my free time I play video games and spend time
                        with my family. I enjoy being outside and I go fishing and hunting as often as I can.
